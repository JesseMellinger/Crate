/*

A lot of our track revolves around allowing users to alter their data. Because of this, we
will definitely need to setup some new mutations here.

These are following mutations we will need:

  - Upload an image
  - Create bio
  - Edit bio
  - Edit email
  - Edit shipping address
  - Edit shipping date
